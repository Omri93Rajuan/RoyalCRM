          CRM systems compile data from a range of different communication channels, including a company's website,
          telephone, email, live chat, marketing materials and more recently, social media. They allow businesses to
          learn more about their target audiences and how to best cater for their needs, thus retaining customers and
          driving sales growth.

          CRM may be used with past, present or potential customers. The concepts, procedures, and rules that a
          corporation follows when communicating with its consumers are referred to as CRM. This complete connection
          covers direct contact with customers, such as sales and service-related operations, forecasting, and the
          analysis of consumer patterns and behaviors, from the perspective of the company.
